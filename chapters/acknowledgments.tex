\addchap{\lsAcknowledgementTitle} 

I'd like to thank the following people for helpful comments and support as I drafted the book. Michael DiPetta, Geoff Pullum, Mel Quezada Claros, Pairoj Kunanupatham, Li Xiang （李想), Leo Schmitt, Hamid Rezaeiyazdi, Will Oxford, Nursena Ozkarakas, Nhat Long Do, Paul Nation, Afandi Setiawan, Nguyen Vu Quynh Lan, and Humber's TESL 5002 students. Nathan Schneider was particularly helpful on prepositions, and Sounak Das provided feedback on each chapter. Every chapter has been greatly improved by the careful attention Peter Evans so kindly gave it. His talent for spotting problems and his sagacity in suggesting solutions has made an immense difference to the quality of the book.

Early in the project, I used ChatGPT 4 and 4.o \citep{openai2023gpt4} and Gemini 1.5 pro \citep{deepmind2023gemini} for \LaTeX ~formatting and problem solving, for generating lists of examples, for proofreading, to suggest missing topics and overlooked points, and to suggest exercises. I also asked it to to create this very description of our collaboration, though, as usual, I've had to rewrite it extensively. More recently, I've been using Claude Opus 3.5 Sonnet \citep{Anthropic2024}, which takes less rewriting.
